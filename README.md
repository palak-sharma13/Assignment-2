java EvenOddArrays
2. SmallestDistance.java
This program finds the index of the first number in the smallest difference pair in an integer array.

Features:
Finds the smallest absolute difference between consecutive elements.

Returns the index of the first number in the smallest difference pair.

Usage:
javac SmallestDistance.java
java SmallestDistance
3. ArrayConversion.java
This program demonstrates conversion between an array and an ArrayList in Java.

Features:
Accepts user input for an array of strings.

Converts an array to an ArrayList and vice versa.

Prints the converted data structures.
